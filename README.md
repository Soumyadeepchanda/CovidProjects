# COVID Data Analysis Project
Welcome to the COVID Data Analysis Repository! This repository contains all the queries, tables, and final dashboards used for analyzing COVID-related data. It aims to provide insights into COVID deaths and vaccinations.

## Work Done
In this project, I have performed the following tasks:

1.Data Collection: Gathered COVID data from reliable sources such as government databases, official health organizations, and public repositories.<br>
2.Data Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed the collected data to ensure accuracy and consistency.<br>
3.Data Analysis: Conducted in-depth analysis on COVID deaths and vaccinations using advanced statistical techniques and data visualization methods.<br>
4.Queries: Developed SQL queries to extract and manipulate relevant data from the database.<br>
5.Tables: Designed and implemented database tables to store the COVID data efficiently.<br>
6.Dashboard Creation: Built interactive dashboards using popular visualization tools to present the analyzed data in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner.<br>
## Dashboards Outcome:
